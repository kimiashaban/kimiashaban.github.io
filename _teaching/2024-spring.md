I was be a TA for MATH 239 in the Spring 2024 term. I was a head TA, where I was in charge of all remark requests, and ensured a high grading standard in a course with over 500 students. I proctered, and held weekly tutorials. I was awarded the [C&O Outstanding TA Award](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/graduate-studies-combinatorics-and-optimization/past-students/outstanding-teaching-assistant-ta-award) for my work!
