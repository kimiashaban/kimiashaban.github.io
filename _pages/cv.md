Research Experience
======

* Faculty Affiliate Researcher, Vector Institute (Fall 2025–Present)  
  * Conduct research in computer vision and machine learning for healthcare as part of my PhD work at the University of Toronto.

* Research Appointee, University Health Network (UHN) (Fall 2025–Present)  
  * Ambient Project; affiliated with the KITE [Aging Team] (https://kite-uhn.com/team/portfolio/aging) and the Intelligent Assistive Technology and Systems Lab ([IATSL])(https://iatsl.org/people/kshaban.html).  
  * Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams on research deliverables (method development/evaluation, analysis, and documentation) supporting aging-related healthcare applications.

* NSERC Undergraduate Research Assistant, Faculty of Mathematics, University of Waterloo — with [Prof. Oliver Pechenik](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~opecheni/) (Spring 2022)  
  * Applied reinforcement learning to study Conjecture 1.3 on the strongly Sperner property of finite Coxeter groups ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05501.pdf)).  
  * Implemented deep Q-learning to search for large antichains in Coxeter groups (types A, B, D, E).  
  * Found evidence consistent with 1-Sperner behavior in selected cases (e.g., \(D_5\), \(D_6\), \(E_6\)).

* Undergraduate Research Assistant, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo — with Prof. Ewa Niechqiej-Szwedo (Spring 2019)  
  * Conducted experiments on sensorimotor and cognitive function following brain injury with control and affected participants.  
  * Filtered eye-tracking recordings for quality (e.g., tracking loss/artifacts) to ensure reliable statistical analysis.  
  * Analyzed visuomotor and binocular vision measures for statistical significance.  
  * Used DataViewer to detect saccades and compare participant response times.
