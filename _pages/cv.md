Education
======
* M.Math in Combinatorics & Optimization, 2024 (expected)
  * Supervisor: Dr. Karen Yeats
  * Thesis: Combinatorial Aspects of Feynman Integrals and Causal Set Theory
  * GPA: 4.0 

* B.Math in Combinatorics & Optimization and Computing, Dean's honour
  * Relevant coursework: 
     * Introduction to Machine Learning (Graduate level: CS680)
     * Optimization for Data Science (Graduate level: CS794)
     * Algebraic Combinatorial Enumeration (Graduate level: CO630)
     * Numerical Computation (CS370)

Research Experience 
======

* NSERC Undergraduate Research Assistant, Faculty of Mathematics, University of Waterloo, with [Assistant Professor Oliver Pechenik](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~opecheni/) (Spring 2022)
  * Used reinforcement learning to visualize conjecture 1.3 to an [open conjecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05501.pdf) on the strongly Sperner property of finite Coxeter groups, in relation to the largest
  possible anti-chain that can be constructed from the poset using weak order.
  * Constructed a deep Q-learning algorithm to find the largest length anti-chains in finite Coxeter groups of types A, B, D and E.
  * Concluded that D5,D6 and E6 are 1-Sperner, and hence had anti-chains of length equal to their order.

* Undergraduate Research Assistant, Faculty of Health, University of Waterloo, with Professor Professor Ewa Niechqiej-Szwedo (Spring 2019)
  * Completed research on sensorimotor and cognitive function following brain injury using Extron Software on control and affected research participants.
  * Filtered results for data quality and errors in tracking rapid eye movements of research participants to ensure accurate data for statistical analysis.
  * Analyzed visuomotor and binocular vision data for statistical significance using motor behaviour detection.
  * Tracked eye-movement with DataViewer to detect saccades, comparing response time of research participants.
