Hi, my name is Kimia! I am a first year Master of Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo. I am incredibly fortunate to have the guidance and support of [Professor Karen Yeats](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~kayeats/) as my advisor, whose expertise and insights have been invaluable to my growth and progress. During my master's, I have also had the wonderful opportunity to work with Dr. Paul-Hermann Balduf, on the applications of maching learning for Feynman period estimation, our work is now published in the [Journal of High Energy Physics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2024)038). 

I completed my Bachelor of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo as well, in Combinatorics & Optimization and Computing, which I graduated with Dean's honour. During my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity of completing an undergraduate research term with [Professor Oliver Pechenik](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~opecheni/) where we used reinforcement learning to further validate a conjecture on the Sperner property of finite Coxeter groups. 

About Me
======
I grew up in Waterloo, Ontario (making my net displacement currently zero). In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, taking hikes with my dog and playing Tetris. Another cool fact about me is that I can type about 140 wpm.
