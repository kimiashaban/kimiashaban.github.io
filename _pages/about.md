Hi, my name is Kimia. I’m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, advised by [Dr. Babak Taati](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~taati/). I work on AI for healthcare and computer vision, and I’m a Faculty Affiliate Researcher at the Vector Institute and a Research Appointee at UHN.

I completed my M.Math in Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo with [Dr. Karen Yeats](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~kayeats/). My Master’s thesis is available [here](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/items/26a83106-75b2-4990-aeb2-ea94bd680a11), and our work on machine learning for Feynman period estimation is published in the [Journal of High Energy Physics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP11(2024)038).

About Me
======
I grew up in Waterloo, Ontario and now live in Toronto. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, taking hikes with my dog, and playing Tetris.
